# Back2U
"Back2U is a mobile application built with Flutter that helps people report and recover lost items within their community. The app allows users to post details of lost or found belongings along with pictures, descriptions, and location tags. Other users can then search, filter, or browse posts to identify possible matches.

To make the process seamless, the app integrates Google Maps for location-based discovery and provides direct contact options (chat, call, or email) between item owners and finders. Users also receive real-time notifications whenever new lost or found items are reported near their area.

By combining a simple interface with powerful features like image uploads, search filters, and geolocation, FindMate acts as a digital bridge that reconnects people with their missing possessions."
